# Dynamic-Programing
Traveller will find best(highest possible value in the bag) path from top-left to bottom-right corner. 
Allowed steps are right or down. After each step traveller will add number it standing on to the bag(include start and finish).
It is extremly effective program because it uses recurrsion and memorization. Recursion ensure best possible path is found by trying every path. That alone would be teribly ineficient.
Memorization is for efectivness if traveller was at the same place but get there with greater value in the bag he will abandon this branch.
