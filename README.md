# Dynamic-Programing
Traveller will find best(highest possible value in the bag) path from top-left to bottom-right corner. 
Allowed steps are right or down. After each step traveller will add number it standing on to the bag(include start and finish).
It is extremly effective program because it uses recurrsion and memorization. Recursion ensure best possible path by trying every path. That alone would be teribly ineficient.
Memorization is for efectivness. Traveller will remember every intermediate step if he notice he was alredy here before but with greater value he understands it was bad start and wont pointlesly explore posibilities when he is on not the best intermediate step.
